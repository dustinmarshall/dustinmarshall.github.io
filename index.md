## Medical AI Chatbot Application
### Software Engineering & Data Analysis Code Sample + Academic Writing Sample
During a Big Data and Development for course for UChicago's MSc in Computational Analysis and Public Policy in Winter 2023, I coded and deployed a cloud-based <a href="https://docgpt.herokuapp.com/">medical AI chatbot</a> using OpenAIâ€™s Completions and Embeddings API endpoints. I used prompt engineering and text embeddings drawn from a knowledge base of 257k doctor-patient dialogues to improve model response. I wrote an accompanying <a href="https://github.com/dustinmarshall/DocGPT/blob/main/research_design.pdf">research design</a> for a health intervention using the app. The application is fully open-source on <a href="https://github.com/dustinmarshall/DocGPT">GitHub</a>.

## Using NLP to Improve Grantee Discovery
### Machine Learning & Data Analysis Code Sample + Blog Writing Sample
During an internship with the Rockefeller Foundation's Data Science team in Summer 2022, I worked on a project mapping the non-profit space with natural language processing and machine learning. I built a subject classification model to classify their corpus of grant proposals to aid grantee discovery. The model is open-source on <a href="https://github.com/dustinmarshall/data_science_subject_classifier">GitHub</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/using-nlp-to-improve-grantee-discovery-adc40f3833f">blog post</a> detailing the process was published on a popular machine learning blog on Medium.

## Genomic Annotation Service Application
### Cloud Engineering Code Sample
During a Cloud Computing course for UChicago's MSc in Computer Science in Spring 2023, I built a custom cloud application with AWS. I used a custom Flask API, EC2 instances for frontend, backend, and utility services, S3 object storage buckets for inputs and outputs, a DynamoDB database for storing user and job data, Lambda functions for maintaining serverless scalable workflows, and SNS messages + SQS queues for communicating between the distributed systems. The Github repo for this project is private, but I've made the exported code available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OJ5KSlXKvHIr8I5Tw-sYudv_NDYaP3Jb/view">here</a>.
