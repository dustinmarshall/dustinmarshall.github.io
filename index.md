## Medical AI Chatbot Application
### Software Engineering & Data Analysis Code Sample + Academic Writing Sample
During a Big Data and Development for course for UChicago's MSc in Computational Analysis and Public Policy in Winter 2023, I coded and deployed a cloud-based <a href="https://docgpt.herokuapp.com/">medical AI chatbot</a> using OpenAIâ€™s Completions and Embeddings API endpoints. I used prompt engineering and text embeddings drawn from a knowledge base of 257k doctor-patient dialogues to improve model response. I wrote an accompanying <a href="https://github.com/dustinmarshall/DocGPT/blob/main/research_design.pdf">research design</a> for a health intervention using the app. The application is fully open-source on <a href="https://github.com/dustinmarshall/DocGPT">GitHub</a>.

## Text Classification Model to Improve Grantee Discovery
### Machine Learning & Data Analysis Code Sample + Blog Writing Sample
During an internship with the Rockefeller Foundation's Data Science team in Summer 2022, I worked on a project mapping the non-profit space with natural language processing and machine learning. I built a subject classification model to classify their corpus of grant proposals to aid grantee discovery. The model is open-source on <a href="https://github.com/dustinmarshall/data_science_subject_classifier">GitHub</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/using-nlp-to-improve-grantee-discovery-adc40f3833f">blog post</a> detailing the process was published on a popular machine learning blog on Medium.

## Genomic Annotation Service Application
### Cloud Engineering Code Sample
During a Cloud Computing course for UChicago's MSc in Computer Science in Spring 2023, I built a custom cloud application with AWS. I used a custom Flask API, EC2 instances for frontend, backend, and utility services, S3 object storage buckets for inputs and outputs, a DynamoDB database for storing user and job data, Lambda functions for maintaining serverless scalable workflows, and SNS messages + SQS queues for communicating between the distributed systems. The Github repo for this project is private, but I've made the exported code available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OJ5KSlXKvHIr8I5Tw-sYudv_NDYaP3Jb/view">here</a>.

## Dashboard Mapping Parks and Underutilized Public Land
### Data Visualization & Geospatial Analysis Code Sample
During a Computer Science course for UChicago's MSc in Computer Science in Winter 2022, my group coded a data vizialization interface in Dash. The interface serves as a tool for urban planners to identify neighborhoods with disproportionately few green spaces and many vacant lots to be considered for conversion. My contribution focused on collecting, cleaning, and wrangling the data on green spaces and vacant lots using the City of Chicago and Cook County's APIs. The code and written report are available on <a href="https://github.com/dustinmarshall/less-vacant-places-more-green-spaces">GitHub</a>.
